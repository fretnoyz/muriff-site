    <p><strong>2025-07-16</strong><br>
    Hello from the band! We’re really excited to be helping out with the new Fort Worth-based music forum. We don’t know what it is yet, but it smells like potential (and alfalfa).</p>

    Roscoe keeps detuning the upright bass to match his “inner groove.” We’re not mad, just confused.</p>

    <p><strong>2025-07-20</strong><br>
    Lester “Moo-tone” is starting drama again. Says the band can’t call itself hornless if he’s holding a sax. He's technically right. But emotionally exhausting.</p>
